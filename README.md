# Marshmallow Quiz

It's a quiz web application with login and register system in Java (using Spring Boot and MySQL database).
You can register new account, log in or just enter your name and take quiz as unauthorized user.
This project will be extended in the future, as I've inteded it to be my private learning app in programming.

The “marshmallow test” said patience was a key to success.
But how do we learn patience?
